Hi, my name is Ole, and I'm a student currently enrolled in the [Mannheim Master in Data Science](https://www.uni-mannheim.de/en/academics/programs/mannheim-master-in-data-science/) program at the University of Mannheim.

In my studies as well as in my free time, I tend to go down a lot of rabbit holes. This site is intended as a, somewhat random, collection of what I find on these adventures.

Below you will find my most recent posts. 

Enjoy!
